# Optimizing-Product-Placement-in-Retail
This project leverages the BigMart Sales dataset to analyze and predict item sales across different retail outlets. Using KNIME Analytics Platform, we cleaned, partitioned, and visualized the dataset to uncover insights that help optimize product placement strategies for higher revenue.

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
Removed missing values in Outlet_Size and Item_Weight.

Final dataset reduced from 8523 to 4650 records for clean analysis.

Verified outlet attributes (Outlet_Size, Outlet_Type, etc.) remained consistent per store.

Identified and flagged anomalies such as Item_Visibility = 0 despite sales.

ðŸ“ˆ Visual Insights
Medium-sized and Supermarket Type 1 outlets contributed most to total sales.

High-selling categories: Fruits & Vegetables, Snack Foods, Household Items.

Outlet OUT027 had the highest sales; OUT019 had the lowest.

Sales were highest in Tier 3 cities, followed by Tier 2 and Tier 1.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
KNIME Analytics Platform for data processing and visualization

Bar Charts, Donut Charts, Pie Charts for visual analysis

ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To assist BigMart in identifying which product categories and store characteristics drive the highest sales, enabling smarter inventory and layout decisions.
